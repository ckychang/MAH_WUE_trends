# MAH_WUE_trends
This repository contains all code needed to reproduce the results and analysis presented in Chang et al. 2021: Chang, K.-Y., Riley, W.J., Keenan, T., 2021. Short-term ecosystem responses to microclimate modulates decadal water use efficiency trends.

The Mann-Kendall Tau non-parametric trend test with Senâ€™s method using the Matlab (MathWorks Inc., 2019, version 9.7.0) ktaub function (downloaded from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11190-mann-kendall-tau-b-with-sen-s-method-enhanced). The violin plot function, used to present the distribution of uWUE trends, is downloaded from http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.51902.

Note that due to data policy restrictions, the original FLUXNET-CH4 database used in Chang et al. 2021 is not redistributed here, but is freely available for download at https://fluxnet.org/.
